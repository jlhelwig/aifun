Playing around with brain.js a javascript AI construct
This is a Neural Network where we find out if a computer can tell the difference between Shakespeare and the Earl of Oxford (who supposedly wrote Shakespeare's plays. Well, it can't but that doesn't prove anything! I don't have a true positive, so I can't prove a true negative.
If I compared Shakespeare to Mark Twain, maybe the AI could tell the difference, but I didn't prove that yet.
Maybe I will add Mark Twain as one of the training sets, and see if there is a change.
